## üìö Projects

**Specializing in LLMs using Chain of Thought Reasoning**  
  - Developed an intelligent system integrating CoT reasoning for improved LLMs in the education domain with step-by-step explanations, using LoRA and QLoRA fine-tuning on models with Apache Airflow and Chroma DB for data pipeline orchestration, retrieval-based augmentation.
  - Deployed a RAG-integrated chat interface to enhance usability, evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and hosted models via AWS (SageMaker, Lambda), Hugging Face, and GCP Vertex AI for scalable performance.

**Transformer-Based NLP for QA**  
  - Applied supervised learning, including classification on time-series data to predict problematic internet use, using Python, ML frameworks like Scikit-learn, and managed models using MLFlow for versioning and MLOps practices.
  - Engineered time-series features, using unsupervised learning to identify patterns, evaluated model performance with QWK, and deployed models with Kubeflow for scalable management, storing data in Parquet for optimized performance.

**Predicting Problematic Internet Use**  
  - Applied supervised learning, including classification on time-series data to predict problematic internet use, using Python, ML frameworks like Scikit-learn, and managed models using MLFlow for versioning and MLOps practices.
  - Engineered time-series features, using unsupervised learning to identify patterns, evaluated model performance with QWK, and deployed models with Kubeflow for scalable management, storing data in Parquet for optimized performance.

**Healthcare Appointment Management System**  
  - Developed an end-to-end system with Python-GUI for UI design and MySQL for data management, enabling appointment bookings and access to prescriptions and medical records.
  - Optimized data pipelines with ETL processes and leveraged Python libraries to monitor KPIs. Utilized SQL, PostgreSQL, and Tableau for efficient data storage and insights with quantitative analysis.
